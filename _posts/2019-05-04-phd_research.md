title: RF Hybrid Amplifier

In 2019 I left my doctoral program at the University of Colorado Boulder with my M.S. in Electromagnetics Engineering and four years of research experience in hybrid solid-state power amplifier design. During my time there, I presented at two conferences and contributed to two T-MTT papers. Forever grateful to have worked with my colleagues in the department and to have been advised and funded by my supporting advisor Dr. Taylor Barton and main advisor Dr. Zoya Popovic!

I also taught summer classes to middle-schoolers in optics, electromagnetics, and Arduino circuits and was awarded my department’s Community Development Award twice for my work as an organizer for the Women in ECEE student interest group. Graduate school was an incredibly powerful and difficult experience, and I came away with a delight and newfound appreciation for teaching and teachers, III-V power amplifier design knowledge from the best of the best, and an ability to do Keysight ADS shenanigans like nobody’s business.

## MMIC Probing and Testing
A visiting colleague designed a MMIC but returned to his home university before the MMIC run was completed and the chips returned. Along with a fellow student I used our lab probe station to perform power and efficiency measurements on the design and presented it at [European Microwave Week 2019.]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /download/duh_mmic.pdf %})

## Carrier Aggregation Signal Testing
[This T-MTT journal paper]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /download/duh_tmtt.pdf %}) uses the dual-band dual-load amplifier previously presented at RWW 2018 as a test piece for Dr. Tommaso Cappello’s novel signal generating algorithm.

## Dual-band Dual-load Amplifier
This paper was presented at URSI and RWW 2018, and details a 3.5/5.9 GHz output matching network I designed for a 6W Cree device and power-added efficiency.

I measured the best PAE after the paper submission deadline but was able to present it at the conferences. My output power ultimately was  36.7/37.1 dBm  at the 3.5/5.9GHz respectively, and PAE of 40.4%/39.9%  with a 5% frequency shift in the upper band.

I contributed work and writing on HFSS numerical solver settings and analysis.
