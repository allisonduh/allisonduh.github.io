I completed 30 credits of graduate-level radio frequency engineering coursework at the University of Colorado Boulder to earn my Master's Degree including:
- Waveguides and Transmission Lines
- Computational Electromagnetics
- Passive RF Design
- Active RF Design
- MMIC Design

Here are some of the final reports and projects from my coursework.
