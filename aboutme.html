        <p>Hello, I'm Allison. <p>

<p>I am a Taiwanese-American East Coast transplant based out of Denver, Colorado. <p>

<p>I have fun as a rock climber, a dabbler in code, a wood-worker, and volunteer educator. I work as a radio frequency engineer and currently serve on the Denver Asian American Pacific Islander Commission.<p>

<p>Looking for collaboration? Please reach out! I am interested in community education, data projects, and climate/greentech. I have a syllabus on Chinese/Taiwanese identity that Iâ€™m hoping particularly to develop further with some students.
