I"5<p>From 2016 to 2017, I taught two courses each summer through CU Science Discovery. This was my first experience teaching out of college and I was so impressed with the creativity of my students! I had a lot of fun learning how to develop curriculums and give interesting lectures with hands-on modules.</p>
