I"—<p>I developed this syllabus in the summer of 2020 as a course for high schoolers to better understand how they fit into Asian American history, to create a healthy, encouraging space to discuss topics like sexuality and civic engagement, and to learn about how our choices and actions today have an impact.</p>

<p>This iteration of the syllabus is meant to center the experiences of Asian American students (target age high school) and emphasize discussion and sharing of experience. Topics include Black Lives Matter, sexuality, and media literacy, and ideally the course would be held in person with lecture time minimized and discussion time maximized.</p>
