I"ý<p>I developed this syllabus in the summer of 2020 as a course for high schoolers to better understand how they fit into Asian American history, to create a healthy, encouraging space to discuss topics like sexuality and civic engagement, and to learn about how our choices and actions today have an impact.</p>

<p>This iteration of the syllabus is meant to center the experiences of Asian American students (target age high school) and emphasize discussion and sharing of experience. Topics include Black Lives Matter, sexuality, and media literacy, and ideally the course would be held in person with lecture time minimized and discussion time maximized.</p>

<p>I have not yet had a chance to teach this as I am still looking for a home for it - if you know of a Chinese school or community that would be interested please reach out! Also, please let me know if you are interested in using the syllabus or have borrowed from it, I would love to hear about how it went and how you would refine it.</p>
