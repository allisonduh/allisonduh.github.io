<p>From 2016 to 2017, I taught two courses each summer through CU Science Discovery. This was my first experience teaching out of college and I was so impressed with the creativity of my students! I had a lot of fun learning how to develop curriculums and give interesting lectures with hands-on modules.

<h2> LEGO Mindstorm Robotics [2016]</h2>
<h3> Class 1 : Girls in STEM </h3>
<ul>
	<li> Students: 9</li>
	<li> Project-based: I encouraged them to work together and shoot higher with multiple bots - for example, one group made their bots take turns in progressing through a boardgame.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Class 2 : Skinner Middle School Summer Academic Focused Education (SAFE) Program</h3>
<ul>
	<li> Students: 29</li>
	<li> Modified LEGO Curriculum: The SAFE course was based on LEGO's "Mission to Space" course material; I rotated groups of students through multiple "mission" modules and asked them to problem-solve how to use their sensors in conjunction with the movement of bots to push buttons, track color, and keep their bot from toppling over. There were also must-have "battle-bot" sessions. Using the LabVIEW-based GUI, I worked with them through concepts of code planning, logic flow, sensor I/O, and more to solve puzzles that I tailored to each class.</li>
</ul>
<p>In both courses, I made sure to show the students videos of lesser-known giants in STEM, such as Margaret Hamilton and Mae Jemison.</p>

<h2>Sparkfun Makerspace [2017]</h2>
<ul>
	<li> Students: 15</li>
	<li> Project-based: This class had no curriculum prescribed, so I chose to build the Luminch One lamp with the students. We worked through introductory Arduino tutorials, and I lectured briefly on basic Ohm's Law and breadboarding techniques. Each of the students was able to take home a lamp that, with a microcontroller connected, responded to an infrared distance sensor.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Electromagnetics [2017]</h2>
<ul>
	<li> Students: 20</li>
	<li> Hands-on demo-based: This course is a hands-on demo-based course that lets students get their hands on physical examples of electromagnetics and dive deeper than school curriculums might normally provide. Each day, the students broke into 3 groups that would rotate through modules each day, which included polarization, diffraction, measuring wavelength (with slinkies and marshmallows) as well as lab tours that I arranged with various professors and students in the CU ECEE department. They also were able to expose their own holograms with Dr. Cho's help! The curriculum for this course was developed years ago by Dr. Suehyun Cho and Dr. Jake Friedlein for CU Science Discovery in partnership with an Upward Bound-type program sponsored by CU and Professor Juliet Gopinath.
