I"»<p>The Women in ECEE group in the CU Engineering School is very near and dear to my heart. It is a space where undergraduate and graduate students can ask each other for their thoughts and experiences with networking or conferences, and have opportunities to talk with professors about the intricacies of academic environments. I was an organizer for WIECEE from 2016-2018 and was awarded the Community Development Award in 2017 and 2018.</p>
