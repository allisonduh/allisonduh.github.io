I"â<p>In 2019 I left my doctoral program at the University of Colorado Boulder with my M.S. in Electromagnetics Engineering and four years of research experience in hybrid solid-state power amplifier design. During my time there, I presented at two conferences and contributed to two T-MTT papers. Forever grateful to have worked with my colleagues in the department and to have been advised and funded by my supporting advisor Dr. Taylor Barton and main advisor Dr. Zoya Popovic!</p>
